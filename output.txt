`package-lock.json` is **never “locked” in the cryptographic sense**; npm can always overwrite it.  
The file is only *advisory* – it records the exact versions that were last installed so that the next `npm ci` (or `npm install` without flags) reproduces the same tree.  
If you want npm to **ignore** that file and always pull the latest versions that still satisfy the ranges in `package.json`, just delete it (and, optionally, never commit it to the repo).

Quick recipes

1. One-off “update everything to latest allowed”
   ```bash
   rm package-lock.json          # or: del package-lock.json  (Windows)
   npm install                   # re-resolves from scratch
   ```

2. Keep it out of your repo altogether
   ```bash
   echo "package-lock.json" >> .gitignore
   git rm --cached package-lock.json
   git commit -m "ignore lockfile"
   ```

3. Never let npm write it again (npm ≤ 6 only)
   ```bash
   npm config set package-lock false
   ```

With npm 7+ the setting was renamed, but the idea is the same—just delete the file and don’t commit it.  
That’s all that is required; there is no other “lock” to break.
